**Step 4: Configure the Environment**

1. INVO requires a connection to a MySQL database. Make sure you have a MySQL server installed and running on your computer. You can download MySQL from https://www.mysql.com/ and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.
2. Create a new MySQL database for INVO to use. You can do this using a MySQL client or by running SQL commands directly in the MySQL command line interface.
3. Once you have created the database, open the `.env.example` file located in the root directory of the INVO repository.
4. Rename the file to `.env` and update the database connection details with your MySQL credentials. For example:
Replace `localhost` with the hostname of your MySQL server, `root` with your MySQL username, `password` with your MySQL password, and `your_database_name` with the name of the database you created for INVO.

DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=password
DB_DATABASE=your_database_name
